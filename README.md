# üìÇ DSA Array Problems

This repository contains solutions to **common Array problems** in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  
Each problem is implemented in **C++** with multiple approaches ‚Äî from **Brute Force** to **Optimal** ‚Äî along with time and space complexity analysis.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Multiple approaches (Brute Force, Better, Optimal).
- Well-commented C++ solutions.
- Time and Space Complexity mentioned for each solution.
- Covers common array problem patterns:
  - Searching & Sorting
  - Prefix/Suffix techniques
  - Two pointers
  - Hashing & Frequency maps
  - Sliding Window
  - Mathematical tricks

## üìò Example Problems
Here are some of the problems solved in this repo:

1. **Product of Array Except Self**  
   - Brute Force, Division Method, Prefix & Suffix (Optimal).  

2. **Count Pairs with Sum Equal to K**  
   - Brute Force, Sorting + Two Pointers, Hash Map (Optimal).  

3. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**  
   - Linear Search, Binary Search (Optimal).  

4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**  
   - Brute Force, Two-Pointer Technique.
